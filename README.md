 # CalPhenology (Calanda Phenology)

**Phenology of Wildflowers**  
This repository provides the data and code used for analyzing wildflower phenology using automated detection and statistical modeling.

---

## Repository Structure

- `data/` : Contains input data files used for model training and analysis  
- `figs/` : Plots and visual outputs generated by the analysis  
- `ANOVAClean.R` : Script for cleaning and preparing data for ANOVA analyses  
- `DataProcessingPredictionsSpeciesLevelAnalyses.R` : Processes species-level prediction outputs  
- `GAMM.R` : Fits generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) to analyze phenological trends  
- `CalPhenology.Rproj` : RStudio project file for seamless project navigation

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajijohn/CalPhenology.git
   ```

2. **Open and run the R project** (`CalPhenology.Rproj`) in RStudio.

3. **To replicate analyses:**
   - Run `DataProcessingPredictionsSpeciesLevelAnalyses.R` first to generate species-level predictions.
   - Use `GAMM.R` to model phenological trends across time, elevation, and canopy gradients.
   - Optional: Run `ANOVAClean.R` for ANOVA-style summary comparisons.

## Requirements

- R (version ≥ 4.0)  
- Key R packages: `mgcv`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and other tidyverse tools  
- YOLOv8 detection outputs (referenced in data scripts)

## Contributions & Further Development

Contributions welcome! Please submit pull requests or issues to propose improvements. Planned updates include:
- Expanding analyses to additional species or multi-year datasets  
- Enhancing visualization outputs in `figs/`  
- Refining statistical models and interpolation methods
